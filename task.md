# Profile Page Implementation Tasks

## Database Models
- [x] User Stats model - tracks problem solving statistics
- [x] User Check-in model - tracks daily activity for heatmap
- [x] User Languages model - tracks programming languages used and their statistics
- [x] User Skills model - tracks problem-solving skills based on tags

## Backend APIs
- [x] GET /api/users/{username}/stats - fetch user statistics
- [x] GET /api/users/{username}/checkins - fetch user check-in history
- [x] POST /api/checkin - record a user's daily check-in
- [x] GET /api/users/{username}/submissions - fetch user's recent submissions
- [x] GET /api/users/{username}/languages - fetch user's language statistics
- [x] GET /api/users/{username}/skills - fetch user's problem-solving skills
- [x] GET /api/users/{username}/discussion-count - fetch user's discussion count

## Admin APIs
- [x] POST /api/admin/rankings/update - update all users' rankings
- [x] POST /api/admin/checkins/generate - generate test check-in data
- [x] POST /api/admin/simulate-stats - generate test statistics for development
- [x] POST /api/admin/languages/generate - generate test language statistics
- [x] POST /api/admin/skills/generate - generate test skill statistics

## Data Processing
- [x] Update user stats when a submission is processed
- [x] Update language statistics when a submission is processed
- [x] Calculate skill levels based on problem tags when a submission is processed
- [ ] Update global rankings periodically (scheduled job)

## Frontend Implementation
- [x] User statistics section - display real stats from API
- [x] Activity heatmap - use real check-in data from API
- [x] Recent submissions - fetch from API instead of using mock data
- [x] Language statistics - fetch from API instead of using mock data
- [x] Skills section - fetch from API instead of using mock data
- [x] Handle loading and error states for all API calls
- [ ] Add UI for initiating a manual check-in
- [ ] Discussion count - fetch from API instead of using mock data

## Additional Features
- [ ] Add streak notifications when user achieves a new streak milestone
- [ ] Add badges and achievements based on problem-solving patterns
- [ ] Implement comparison with other users
- [ ] Implement profile customization options
- [ ] Implement public/private profile settings
